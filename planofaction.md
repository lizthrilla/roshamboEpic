# Epic Mode
1. make const for remembering (memory)
2. when player wins, record memory
3. when computer wins, record memory
4. getComputerMove


## adventure mode:
**goal: track the result of multiple games (matches), after the match the winner is shown and the player is given a leader board and prompt to play again**
##### throw = engagement; 2:3 engagements = bout; 2:3 bouts = match

I want to create a match function where if (computer || player === 2 bouts) {matchOver()}

1. create way to track engagements (i already have it)
--changed gameOver to boutOver and said that you lost the bout.  **I need to create a bout tracker/leaderboard**



2. create way to track bouts (playerBout and computerBout)
3. **goes into reset?**create boutOver() based off gameOver()
  a. will need to change the script a bit to say you lost the bout
4. if (computerBouts || playerBouts === 2){
boutOver()
}
5. create leader board in html and css
6. bout change score like game score
7. create matchOver() based off gameOver()
7. if('computerBout' || playerBout === 2){
matchOver()
}
